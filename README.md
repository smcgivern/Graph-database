This graph database contains all [simple graphs][simple] with seven
vertices or fewer. It is used in the Open University course [MT365 -
Graphs, networks and design][mt365]. The software that comes with this
course has the database as a text file, but the viewer doesn't work
too well with [Wine][wine], hence this project.

It's generated using some Ruby scripts to wrap around
[Graphviz][graphviz] and produce the HTML, SVG, and PNG files. These
scripts are available to clone at GitHub as
[seanmcgivern/graph-database][github], _without_ the corresponding
source database - this can only be found on the MT365 course DVD.
